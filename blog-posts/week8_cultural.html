        <h1>Emotional Conflicts</h1>
        <h2>September 25, 2014</h2>
        <div class="content">
          <p>Emotional conflicts occur on a daily if not weekly occurrence in my life. I have a wife, a big family, opinionated and loving friends. Lots of room for emotional conflict! Some times it is healthy to get it out, other times not so much.</p>
          <p>Leading up to our wedding, my wife and I had many arguments. Outside stress coupled with the anxiety of an impending marriage, plus our differences of opinions on matters would often make for a perfect storm of conflict. Sometimes we argued. Sometimes we didn't speak. Other times, we talked through it or just laughed and got it over with right away.
</p>
          <p>Speaking just regarding my own actions, I can say about 50 percent of the times I made it better and the other half I probably made it worse. I am often times impatient, and unfortunately my mouth often moves quicker than my brain leading to things that should not be said! In this case, as in most cases of emotional conflict, I don't try to "go back" and harp over what can be done differently. That is definitely not healthy. All you can do is take whatever lesson you learned and work towards doing better the next time a conflict arises.</p>
