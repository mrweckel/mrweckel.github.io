        <h1>Think!</h1>

          <p>I am what you would call Concrete Random. Or so that is what Gregorc quiz says I am. Although I tend to stay away from any type of label that would group me in to any one category (with the exception of  "handsome" and "extraordinary"), for the sake of this article I will play along. </p>
          <p>There are definitely a few aspects of the Concrete Random thinking style that I can use at DBC to help me. Let's focus on two of CR's most defining characteristics, experimentation and taking risks. Being in an environment at DBC that allows me the comfort and freedom to try things you would never be able to try in other educational environments, and especially work for that matter, will do wonders for this attribute of my thinking style. </p>
          <p>Of course, so far in phase 0, not everything has been completely smooth sailing. I definitely have difficulties when it comes to a lot of reading! I much rather get my hands dirty and start experimenting with concepts right away and reference and read as I go. I have developed a good way of dealing with this though, and that is while reading, I will take a break and go find a visual or hands-on tutorial to help me solidify those concepts.</p>
          <p>While keeping an open mind and keeping a growth mind-set I have definitely bought in (not without some trepidation) in to the group and pair oriented part of DBC's education process. Apparently, a Concrete Random thinker might have problems with outside authority sometimes (ahem), which I can definitely say is true for me a lot. This makes it difficult for me sometimes to work with others in the most effective way possible. But even the first few weeks of DBC has helped me to get better at this already!</p>
