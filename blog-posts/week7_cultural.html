        <h1>Values</h1>
        <h2>September 19, 2014</h2>
        <div class="content">
          <p>I was married one week ago today. As cliched as this sounds, it was indeed the happiest day of my life. To see all my favorite people in one place sharing in our happiness was surreal and wonderful. On that day, I felt a sense of Accomplishment, Closeness, Confidence, Control, Excitement, Friendship, Family, Growth, and Loyalty. Look, I could go on and on but I will stop there for now.</p>
          <p>Loyalty is important to me for a variety of reasons. Growing up an Italian-American in Brooklyn, we were all infused with this sense of loyalty; never turn on your friends, respect your family, never "rat" on any one. Even though I no longer live in that environment (I'm not sure it even exists any more)I try to take a lot of these notions and apply them to my life in all aspects.</p>
          <p>In general, I would say that I live up to my values as close as possible. When someone asks me advice on some problem going on in their lives, I always try to remind them of their value system. If you think about what is important to you, it becomes (somewhat) easier to make the hard decisions.</p>
          <p>There are also plenty of exercises I recommend to people when they are feeling down or questioning themselves and their decisions. Meditate. RUN! Breathing exercises. But most importantly, I advise people to write down their feelings and identify which of their feelings are irrational and which ones aren't.</p>
