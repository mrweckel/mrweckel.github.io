        <h1>Relative, Absolute, and Fixed Positioning</h1>
        <h2>August 15, 2014</h2>
        <div class="content">
          <p>For me, positioning is by war the most confusing and frustrating part of working with CSS. I find it to just be a tedious trial and error process where I am changing this element to relative, that one to absolute, but wait that throws these other child elements out of whack! BLEH. I will attempt to understand the position attribute by trying to explain it here.</p>
          <p>Let's start with relative positioning.  Using relative positioning in combination with other position attributes will move an element relative to where it should be. Let's use an example. When not explicitly declaring a position for an element, it is set to static. If I went ahead and used other position attributes and set bottom to 100px, nothing would happen. Now if I changed the position attribute from static to relative, the element will now move upwards on the page 100px from where it would have been.</p>
          <p>This leads in to absolute positioning. This means that you can position an element anywhere you want on the page, relative to the parent element. If an element has no explicit parent, it will treat the over <html> element as it's parent and you can position according to that.
</p>
          <p>Fixed positioning is used when you want to position an element relative to the browser window itself. Fixed positioning is very useful when it comes to scrolling on a web page. Usually when a user scrolls up and down on a page, the elements move with it. Any element with a fixed position will stay where it is on the page. You've probably seen this effect used with menu navigations and social networking buttons that the designer wants to be readily available to the user at all positions on the site.</p>
          <p>Well, this definitely helped me gain a better understanding of the position process. I hope it helped you as well. Oh wait, wait. I forgot. No one is reading this.
