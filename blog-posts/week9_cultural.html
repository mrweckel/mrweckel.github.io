        <h1>Asking Better Questions</h1>
        <h2>September 30, 2014</h2>
        <div class="content">
          <p>One of my biggest pet peeves is being asked a question that can easily be Googled. I will say though that I am also guilty of doing this myself, and it annoys me most when I do it! But sometimes, you have exhausted all of the forums and information out there on the web (at least in one language) and need to pose the question yourself. Here are some questions I have posed, and how I can improve on them in the future.</p>
          <p>"Does anyone have any idea how to use sqrt in ruby?" </p>
          <p>First off, starting a question with "Does anyone have any idea..." is already a failure. I find that when you throw out general calls-to-action like this one, people tend to think someone else will help. Plus, it shows that you really haven't done much research in regards to the topic. And that pisses people off. This is a perfect example of the "Just Google It Principle".</p>
          <p>"Subject: FCP7 Constant Crashing."</p>
          <p>Here is an example of a subject title for a forum question that is just too general. Even though my question was very detailed, the subject definitely could have given a little more information, and not just for my own sake. If someone is googling the same problem I am having, they would have a better chance of finding it if my subject heading was better.</p>
          <p>If you take anything away from this blog post, make sure it's to "Just Google It".</p>
