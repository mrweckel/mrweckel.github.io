          <p>In putting "Why is JavaScript popular?" in my google search, I was definitely surprised to see most of the top hits were not an explanation of the usefulness of the language, or praising it for it's years of dedicated service to web development. But rather, they were articles from the last couple of years talking about how JavaScript WILL become the dominant language in the near future. And more than one seemed a tad bit defensive about it.</p>
          <p>While this will be a gross simplification, JavaScript is popular because it works well in tandem with HTML and CSS to add fast user interactivity with the site. This has only been enhanced by HTML5, which biggest change from it's older version was enabling JavaScript to do even more than it could before. One of the best comments I found while searching away on sites comes from a user named jessamyn on ask.metafilter.com who said "I think of Javascript as a little thing you can build into a web page that lets a website DO some things on its own without always phoning home to a server that may be thousands of miles away." Ah, so JavaScript makes web pages more responsive quicker.</p>
          <p>But what of it's limitations? I did indeed find that the people who sing JavaScript's praises were simultaneously defending it. Obviously, there are reasons some people have less than positive things to say about the language. One of my favorite resources on this topic was from the wonderfully named "Your language sucks wiki", in which reasons from Camel case sucks to automatic type conversion. My personal biggest complaint is that object creation and adding properties seems a little clunky. Oh well.</p>
          <p>From what I read, it doesn't appear that JavaScript is going anywhere any time soon, so no matter how you feel about it...Best learn that shit.</p>
