          <h1>REFLECTION</h1>

          <h2>What parts of your strategy worked? What problems did you face?</h2>
            <p>This was my first pairing session and I believe we followed the protocol to a T. Our strategy to have my partner drive through the first half, and I drove through the second. Strategically, I do not believe that either of us faced any problems.</p>

          <h2>What questions did you have while coding? What resources did you find to help you answer  them?</h2>
            <p>We definitely had a few questions on the best way to move the menu from the side bar to top bar. Also, we had questions about how to get text to be fluid. We used various sources found through a google search.</p>

          <h2>What concepts are you having trouble with, or did you just figure something out? If so, what?</h2>
            <p>We initially have trouble with media query concepts but definitely gained a better understanding as the session progressed.</p>


          <h2>Did you learn any new skills or tricks?</h2>
            <p>I learned about using vw as a measurement for text to make it fluid. Very helpful.</p>

          <h2>How confident are you with each of the Learning Competencies?</h2>
            <p>I feel confident. But I definitely need more time on media queries.</p>

          <h2>Which parts of the challenge did you enjoy?</h2>
            <p>I enjoyed working with a partner and solving our issues together.</p>

          <h2>Which parts of the challenge did you find tedious?</h2>
            <p>Moving the navigation from the side bar to the top bar. It shouldn't have been that difficult! I found it tedious to continue trial and error until it finally worked.</p>
