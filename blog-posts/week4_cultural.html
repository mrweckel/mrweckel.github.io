        <h1>Problems in Tech</h1>
        <h2>August 27, 2014</h2>
        <div class="content">
          <p>Well, one quick google search of "Problems with Tech Industry" will provide a wealth of information on a bunch of different issues. Drug addiction, sexism, too small of both a minority and female presence. And, to be honest, there's a probably a thousand more issues and millions of facts and stats to go over to write a proper piece on the subject in my 90 minute time limit. So for the sake of time, I am focusing less on a problem and more on one type of solution.</p>
          <p>Made With Code is a google initiative that aims to get young girls interested in a career in coding. The site tells the story of both women who are established in the industry, and young girls who are just getting their start. All the stories are a lot of fun and are a great source of inspiration for a young kid who is just thinking about what they want to do with their life. Hell, it was an inspiration to a grown man who is trying to figure out the answer to that exact same question.</p>
          <p>The site also hosts a bunch of projects designed to show girls just how fun coding can be. And they are pretty fun! I might have just tried a few myself.</p>
          <p>I love that one of the biggest tech companies in the world is spending some of their money to guide the next industry of tech workers. The tech world could only benefit from having more talented, intelligent women in it, and it seems that this is definitely a step in the right direction.</p>
