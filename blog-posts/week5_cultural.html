        <h1>Pairing</h1>
        <h2>September 03, 2014</h2>
        <div class="content">
          <p>I am definitely someone who would not go out of my way to work with other people, so I'm glad here at DBC it's a requirement. It's been helpful for numerous reasons and it's always wonderful to meet new people and see how they approach solving a problem.</p>
          <p>In my pairing sessions, I have had only really good experiences. Everyone has been helpful, intelligent, kind and willing to try different things. Without a doubt, in each session, I have had multiple moments where I have thought "Oh I didn't know that" or "I wouldn't have thought of that!"</p>
          <p>With that being said, I tend to be quite impatient at timesâ€¦There are so many times where I just want to type away without waiting for the other person, or when I have an idea I just want to try it without having to explain to the other person what I want to do! In fact, in one of the feedbacks I received, someone mentioned there were times where I was going off on my own a bit!</p>
          <p>Well, I am getting better at that though, which is another positive of pairing! Maybe I'll become more patient in other aspects of my life as well. I know my wife would appreciate that.</p>
