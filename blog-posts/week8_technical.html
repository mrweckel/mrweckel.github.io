        <h1>What the @$%! is Rails?</h1>

          <p>Normally, I wouldn't open up a conversation such as this with a dictionary quote, but it the case of Rails I will. "Rails is a web application development framework written in the Ruby language. It is designed to make programming web applications easier by making assumptions about what every developer needs to get started." As a newcomer to almost all things programming this definition, taken from rubyonrails.org, really did not clarify anything for me. So I decided to install rails and do some tutorials, and walk you through the process!</p>
          <p>First, I installed rails. Pretty simple. Just a little "gem install rails" action. Received an error about permissions but set my rbenv global, and success. I checked to see what version of rails I had installed and moved on to the tutorial.</p>
          <p>Some more quote love for you: "Rails comes with a number of scripts called generators that are designed to make your development life easier by creating everything that's necessary to start working on a particular task." Following the example on rubyonrails.org, I typed "rails new blog" in to the command line, and saw a bunch of fun stuff being installed in this new blog directory. Names like activerecord, and jquery, and sqlite3 flashed on the terminal. And the blog directory now had a whole crap load of folders and files that were not there before. I was feeling like I was getting somewhere.</p>
          <p>I could write down every single that happened next, but then I would just be copying information that already exists in a more concise, and much better presented way so I won't. That would be very DRY of me. But I will say that I did things such as create a controller and a view; I changed routes and saw "Hello Rails!" displayed on my screen, and much much more!</p>
          <p>In conclusion, I think I get it. Rails is simply a collection of scripts, databases, and other code brought together in one place for easy loading and accessing whenever a developer wants to create a new web application. It keeps the developer from writing code that has already been written, and makes interacting across languages an platforms as easy as typing in a keyword. It creates servers to test the application. It does things I don't even know about yet. It's awesome. And I can't wait to learn more.</p>
