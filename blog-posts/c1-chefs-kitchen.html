        <h1>DBC Here I Come</h1>
        <h2>August 08, 2014</h2>
        <div class="content">
          <p>I have the tendency to be a little bit of a jaded New York about, well, just about everything. So it goes without saying that even though I have done the research about DBC, heard amazing things about what’s in store, and wrote a check for 12.2 g’s, there is that part of me that’s like “how great can it be”?  And, at the risk of having my “true” New Yorker’s status revoked, homeboy’s fireside chat just got me pumped about DBC.</p>
          <p>This is what I’m all about. I’m not worried at all anymore about this program. And I have the tendency to worry. I can’t wait to get in there, meet and work with some awesome people, and make some awesome shit. Plain and simple. I will do a bunch of yoga, write a million blog posts, and go to the Financial District(!) every morning with a crazy big smile on my face, because I really am excited to be in this environment.</p>
          <p>Shereef, for a dude in a hoodie on a crappy google+ feed, you got me pumped like I was just watching Bill Pullman’s classic Independence Day speech. Well done, sir. Well done.</p>
