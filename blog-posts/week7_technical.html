        <h1>SQL or NoSQL</h1>
        <h2>September 19, 2014</h2>
        <div class="content">
          <p>It took me a while to grasp just what separated SQL from NoSQL, and found myself to be more than a little perturbed by the vague descriptions given about both. But in the middle of my research, I was listening to and NPR story about the referendum in Scotland on whether to gain complete independence from the UK and it all clicked! So let's milk this analogy for all it's worth shall we?</p>
          <p>At the time of this writing, the voters in Scotland just decided to remain a part of the UK by just 10 percentage points. It is the standard. It is safe. It has "worked" for these citizens' entire lives. There are things they don't like, sure. But at least they know how the system operates. By now, I'm sure you have guessed, this side is our SQL.</p>
          <p>SQL is a system of tables. It is linear, and was created long before programmers were using object-oriented programming. Popular thinking, in not just programming, is more of a web (as in spider) or a tree, with branches and connections between all different types of data. This simply does not and will not happen with SQL. But, it works. And it has worked for a long time.</p>
          <p>Independence! Something fresh and new. The citizens of Scotland who voted to leave the UK knew there would be immediate economic and social repercussions for this action, but believed in time it would create a stronger Scotland once they got over those initial hurdles. </p>
          <p>Well, a switch to NoSQL, which affectionately stands for Not Only SQL, would be quite the painful transition as well, with just as many question marks at the end of the day. NoSQL databases would be less structured, working on a key based solution (maybe that sounds familiar to you Rubyists). Madness!</p>
          <p>There is plenty more for me to learn about SQL and NoSQL, but I feel that I am off to a good start. In the words of my Scottish friends, "Whit's fur ye'll no go by ye!"</p>
