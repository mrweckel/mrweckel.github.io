                    <h3>What is pair programming?</h3>
                    <p>The process of two people working simultaneously on a piece of code to fix a bug or develop a program. There are usually 2 roles: the driver and the navigator. </p>

                    <h3>Why is pair programming important to DBC?</h3>
                    <p>Pair programming is important for a few reasons:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>It prepares you for the marketplace/realworld. You will have to collaborate with other programmers in work, and practicing this process in DBC makes you better at it!</li>
                        <li>Develops interpersonal and teamwork skills. You have to communicate ideas and explain concepts to another person while working for a common goal, making you a more collaborative person.</li>
                        <li>Create more complete solutions. Two brains working on one problem is better than one.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Driver vs Navigator</h3>
                   <p>The driver is the person with the key. They are at the keyboard and actually creating the code.</p>
                   <p>The navigator is the person who guides the driver through the problem. They have space to think about the big picture while the driver works on the details.</p>

                    <h3>Reflection</h3>
                   <p>I enjoyed my first guided pairing session very much. Diana and I worked very seamlessly together, and despite our different work styles were able to work through some issues and finish the challenge.I found stypi to be a little underwhelming and would rather just screen share our sublime screens.</p>
