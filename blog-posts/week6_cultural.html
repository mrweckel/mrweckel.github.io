        <h1>Stereotype Threat</h1>
        <h2>September 08, 2014</h2>
        <div class="content">
          <p>I was blown away that I was unfamiliar with this term, but was not all that surprised by the findings  of Claude M. Steele and his colleagues. As someone who has battled anxiety and feelings of inadequacy in life (and really, who hasn't), I began to think back to times where I might have defeated myself before I even began.</p>
          <p>For the past 5 years, I have worked in the filmmaking/media world. I never studied film or media in school, and much of what I have learned was either self-taught or on-the-job training. There have been many times where I have worked on projects with people who went to prestigious film schools, and I either explicitly felt intimidated, or later realized that my contribution to the conversation was lacking when normally it wouldn't have been. </p>
          <p>I was aware of this problem although I didn't know the term associated with it, and in recent years have begun to deal with issue. I have forced myself to assert myself even when feeling doubts about my abilities, and have eased up on beating myself up when my performance is not 100 percent, or if I said something "not so smart".</p>
          <p>find myself in, I can actively pursue social and work situations with intelligent, empathetic people. This will raise my comfort level, and allow me to engage when not feeling entirely confident.</p>
