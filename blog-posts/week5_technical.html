        <h1>Ruby Classes</h1>
        <h2>September 03, 2014</h2>
        <div class="content">
          <p>Let's talk about ruby classes. We're not going to get in to the definition and everything you can know and do with them, but instead we'll look at an example using a real-world object to get a better understanding!</p>
          <p>Let's say I am writing a fantasy novel(nerd!), and in my imaginary world there is a group of people who only speak a language called Weckelan. I want this language to feel as real as possible, so I am going to make up at least 2,000 words that I can pick and choose from when those characters speak. I am going to create a Language class to help me keep track of these words and make sure I don't repeat any.</p>
          <p>Now I am not going to write out the entire code, but let's take a look at the basic structure of my new Language class:</p>
          <p id="code1">class Language</p>
          <p id="code2"> def initialize(word)</p>
          <p id="code3">@word = word</p>
          <p id="code2">end</p>
          <p id="code2">def check</p>
          <p id="code3">#check if word exists already in the language</p>
          <p id="code2">end</p>
          <p id="code2">def add_word</p>
          <p id="code3"> #if word does not exist add the word to the language.</p>
          <p id="code2">end</p>
          <p id="code1">end</p>
          <p>word001 = Language.new("fghuteroudo")</p>
          <p id="code1">word001.add_word</p>
          <p>After I have created the Language class, I am then initializing the class by turning the word variable that holds the argument to be checked in to an instance variable so it can be used across the class. Then I create a new method to check if the word exists, and finally one more method to add the word to the language.</p>
          <p>So then when I create a new word, I create a new instance of that class and call add_word on that instance to either add the word if it doesn't exist yet, or return an error of some kind. I might just go make up a language now to try this out!</p>
