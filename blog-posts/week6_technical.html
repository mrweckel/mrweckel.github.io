        <h1>OOP vs. Functional Programming</h1>
        <h2>September 08, 2014</h2>
        <div class="content">
          <p>After looking at the different options for the tech blog this week, I decided to tackle the topic of Object Oriented Programming(OOP) vs. Functional Programming(FP) because I really had zero clue about it. I would say now, after reading up about it on various blogs, forums, and the ExplainLikeImFive subreddit that I know slightly more than zero.</p>
          <p>Before I even begin my sad attempt at approaching this topic, I'd like to talk about a few glaring issues I noticed during my research. One, this is not a cut and dry answer. There is some debate out there as to what the exact definition of these two types of programming is. Secondly, I realized before I could even begin to understand their differences, I needed to research a few other terms that were being thrown around during the various discussions including composition, mutability, reduction, recursiveness, and stateless. For the sake of time, I will not be discussing these terms in detail here, but they should definitely be looked-up.</p>
          <p>Ok, on to the main event. The first difference to understand between OOP and FP is that the former's basic unit of composition is, as you might have guessed, an object, and the latter's is a function. Great, what the hell does that mean? Well, an object is a complex structure that is mutable, while a function contains data that should be immutable and can take on other functions as its input.</p>
          <p>Here are a few more differences. Functional programming stays away from loops, using a recursive method of calling itself instead. OOP can also do this as well, however. Also, OOP is also reliant on functions as well, so I think when people refer to FPas the opposite of OOP, there are oversimplifying a complex issue.</p>
          <p>After writing this post, I definitely feel that it is too early in my programming career to understand the major strengths and weaknesses of OOP and FP, and look forward to getting a better grasp on the situation as my experience grows.</p>
