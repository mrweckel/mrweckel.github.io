        <h1>Comparing My Favorite Websites</h1>
        <h2>August 08, 2014</h2>
        <div class="content">
          <p>In all the time I spend online reading the standard mixture of enlightening articles, current events, and just plain crap, until now I never really questioned what attracted me to these sites. I guess I always assumed it was the content. Good or bad. The content is what drove me there. But is it what kept me there?</p>
          <p>Three of my favorite sites. Boom. Here you go: IFLScience, Gothamist and The Verge. Check em just about everyday. Sometimes I feel great when Im done, and sometimes I just cant get over how much time I regularly give away as if it were in never ending supply. I love these sites because I can quickly jump in to their content, learn a thing or two, and then jump back out quickly and easily. </p>
          <p>As soon as you visit IFLScience, you are hit in the face with mind-bending imagery and some really loud colors. Not for everyone. But for me, when it comes to my science, I want it sexy and high-def, and slightly dumbed down. I can easily scroll thorough articles for a long while, and although there is strong clutter of animated gif ads and other assaults on the senses, most of the time I hardly notice it.</p>
          <p>The Verge is another site that greats you with in-your-face colors, large images, and host full of ads. On top of all that it throws on top a rainbow-style hero module that I think contains contain. But who the hell can tell through all the crazy colors. I check The Verge mainly for the tech articles, but I suppose I could get the same news from Mashable, Wired, reddit/r/technology, and any of the other hundreds of tech blogs.</p>
          <p>Now The Gothamist is my guilty rag sheet pleasure. It is not as colorful and sensory as the two previous sites I have discussed, but the content (while under the guise of NYC news), is just as big of an assault on the senses. Itâ€™s layout is simple, especially on a smart phone. I scroll down, read a bunch of news I never really needed to know, and I move on. Sometimes simple is exactly what my brain needs.</p>
          <p>Well, this exercise has reminded just how much of my life I spend, and will continue to spend, staring at a screen of some kind or another. It has also reminded me of how much I hate blogging, especially when maybe 2 people will read this. If you have made it this far, please get up from the computer and go for a walk. Cheers.</p>
